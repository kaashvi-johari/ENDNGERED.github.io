The Asiatic lions are endangered animals that only live in the Gir national park in gujarat.
they have been endangered because of its small population size, area of occupancy and loss
of habitat, since the year 2000, and were protected under the national wildlife protection
act and several initiatives taken by the WWF. There are around 650 Asiatic lions left in Gir
national park now.

The animal can be found in India and Nepal, particularly in the foothills of the Himalaya
and in the state of assam. Poaching of horns is an important reason for the decline in the
number of the Indian Rhinoceros. they are mainly inhabitants of the kaziranga national park,
although few have been spotted in Kaziranga National Park, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, Pobitora
Wildlife Sanctuary as well. They have been endangered since 1975 and only 600 were left then.
however with constant efforts from the Indian and Nepal government they have now around 3500
rhinos left.
