    In India, leatherback turtles nest mainly in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. But where they go from there is not known. Leatherback turtles are the largest of living sea turtles, growing up to two metres and weighing as much as 900 kg. however these leatherback turtles are now on the brink of extinction because of plastic bags floating in the ocean. Pacific leatherback sea turtles mistake these plastic bags for jellyfish; an estimated one-third of adults have ingested plastic.</p>
