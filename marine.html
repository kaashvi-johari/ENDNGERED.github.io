Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.
But the species is extinct from most. The Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is essentially blind.
These dolphins are hunted by people in the Brahmaputra River for meat and by fishermen in the Ganges River for oil.
River dolphins trapped in dams are the target of poachers specially in the summers when the waters begin to dry and
also are littered by humans.</td>

In India, leatherback turtles nest mainly in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. But where they go from there
is not known. Leatherback turtles are the largest of living sea turtles, growing up to two metres and weighing 
as much as 900 kg. however these leatherback turtles are now on the brink of extinction because of plastic bags 
floating in the ocean. Pacific leatherback sea turtles mistake these plastic bags for jellyfish; an estimated
one-third of adults have ingested plastic.</td>
