                In India, leatherback turtles nest mainly in the Andaman and Nicobar islands.
                But where they go from there is not known.Leatherback turtles are the largest
                of living sea turtles, growing up to two metresand weighing as much as 9Okgs.
                However these leatherback turtles are now on the brink of extinction because 
                of plastic bags floating in the ocean. Pacific leatherback sea turtles mistake
                these plastic bags for jellyfish; an estimated of  one-third of adults have 
                ingested plastic.

                  the biggest species of duck.Its body is black and its head is white thickly 
                  spotted with black, it has conspicuous white patches on its wings and orange
                  or red eyes.This forest duck is listed as Endangered because it has a very 
                  small and fragmented population which is undergoing a very rapid and continuing
                  decline as a result of the loss of and disturbance to riverine habitats. They
