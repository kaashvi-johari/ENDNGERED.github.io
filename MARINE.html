<p2>
*In India, leatherback turtles nest mainly in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. But whe
they go from there is not known.
*Leatherback turtles are the largest of living sea turtles, growing up to two metres
and weighing as much as 900 kg.
*However these leatherback turtles are now on the brink of extinction because of plastic
 bags floating in the ocean. Pacific leatherback sea turtles mistake these plastic bags 
 for jellyfish; an estimated one-third of adults have ingested plastic.</p2>

<p4>
 *Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river systems of Nepal, India,
  and Bangladesh.
 *But the species is extinct from most.The Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is
  essentially blind.
 *These dolphins are hunted by people in the Brahmaputra River for meat and by fishermen in the Ganges
  River for oil. River dolphins trapped in dams are the target of poachers specially in the summers when
  the waters begin to dry and also are littered by humans.
