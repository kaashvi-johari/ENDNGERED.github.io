                 *In India, leatherback turtles nest mainly in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. But where they go from
                  there is not known.
                 *Leatherback turtles are the largest of living sea turtles, growing up to two metres
                  and weighing as much as 900 kg. 
                 *However these leatherback turtles are now on the brink of extinctionbecause of plastic bags floating in
                  the ocean. Pacific leatherback sea turtles mistake these plasticbags for jellyfish; an estimated one-
                  third of adults have ingested plastic.

                    *Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river systems of Nepal, India,
                     and Bangladesh.
                    *But the species is extinct from most.Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is
                     essentially blind. 
                    *These dolphins are hunted by people in the Brahmaputra River for meat and by fishermen in the Ganges
                     River for oil. River dolphins trapped in dams are the target of poachers specially in the summers
                     when the waters begin to dry and also are littered by humans.
